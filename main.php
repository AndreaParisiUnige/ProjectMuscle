        <p> Conied in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, the term "unicorn startup
            refers to a private company valued at or over 1$ bilion - because just like the
            mythical creature, the statistical rarity of such successful buisness venture is
            improbable, but not impossible.
